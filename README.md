# Fundamentals-Again
Pre-work Phase II. Consists of three seperate required videos. They make up some of the fundamentals that we have learned. Variable and Types, Conditionals and Functions, and APIs, Objects, and Interfaces were the 3 videos. The Again appended to the end is because I'm creating a new repository using the correct process.
